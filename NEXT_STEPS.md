# Frontend: http://localhost:3000

# 2. Test key functionality:
# - User registration/login
# - Product browsing
# - Cart operations
# - Payment flow (test mode)
# - Profile management

# 3. Check API endpoints
curl http://localhost:5001/api/products
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production Immediately
Choose one deployment method:

npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway deploy
```

#### B. **Render** (Simple - 15 minutes)
- Connect GitHub repo to Render
- Add environment variables in dashboard
- Auto-deploy with git push

#### C. **VPS Server** (Full Control - 30 minutes)
- DigitalOcean Droplet ($10/month)
- Use provided deployment scripts
- Configure domain and SSL

### Option 3: Docker Deployment (Advanced)
```bash
# You already have Docker setup ready!
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📝 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED**

### 1. **Update Domain Configuration** (5 minutes)
- Update `nginx.conf` with your actual domain name
- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain

### 2. **Complete Environment Setup** (10 minutes)
